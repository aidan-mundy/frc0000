Spartan Robotics has always been more than robots—we’re a tight-knit group of student innovators, eager to share our appreciation of STEM with the community around us. Since our inception in 2002, our goal has been to make FIRST synonymous with the student-led, supportive, and engaging environments we create within the team and wherever our outreach leads us. Spreading this philosophy of cooperative and experience-based learning through ascending levels of influence—our team, our school district, our region, and beyond—will increase the retention of underrepresented groups, facilitate better STEM education, and encourage the creativity that is essential to the FIRST experience.
